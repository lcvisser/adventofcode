My attempts at solving the Advent Of Code puzzles (www.adventofcode.com).

This is primarily a learning exercise for myself. The goal is to look back later and have learned better ways to solve
a particular problem in the mean time. When I get stuck, I might look up other people's solutions for inspiration, but
only after the event has finished. Any commits done after the end of the events are from me puzzling along a bit
longer, probably with some help.

Progress so far:

- 2024: 40*
- 2023: 23*
- 2022: 50*
- 2021: 27*
- 2020: 31*
