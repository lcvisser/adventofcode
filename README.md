My attempts at solving the Advent Of Code puzzles (www.adventofcode.com).

This is primarily a learning exercise for myself. The goal is to look back later and have learned better ways to solve
a particular problem in the mean time. When I get stuck, I might look up other people's solutions for inspiration (I
especially like [Martijn Pieters' writeups](https://github.com/mjpieters/adventofcode)), but only after the event has
finished. Any commits done after the end of the events are from me puzzling along a bit longer, probably with some help.
